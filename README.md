# satellite-constellation

Visual ecosystem explorer and search engine for discovering [NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md) groups in the context of your web of trust

Currently a very primitive mockup.

Though it's being iterated on as a standalone app currently, I plan to move this into [satellite-web](https://github.com/lovvtide/satellite-web)
